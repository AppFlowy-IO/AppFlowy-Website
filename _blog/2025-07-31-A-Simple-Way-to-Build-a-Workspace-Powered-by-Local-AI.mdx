When you're managing sensitive tasks or need control over your environment, relying on the cloud doesn't always make sense. We understand that modern teams need more than speed—they need privacy, security, and full control. Local AI offers all of that and more.

With AppFlowy, you can run AI features directly inside your workspace using models like gemma3 or qwen3 through Ollama. Your tools remain functional even without internet access, and your data stays where it belongs: with you.

Today, [25% of organizations already report having processes fully enabled by AI with widespread adoption](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/ai-statistics), showing how trusted automation is no longer optional, but expected.

## Local AI That Works Right Inside Your Workspace

Running AI models locally isn't just a technical choice—it's a productivity shift. With local AI, you get instant response time, greater control over your outputs, and assurance that your work never leaves your device.

Here are just a few reasons to consider local AI:

* **Speed:** No more waiting for server-side processing. Local models respond instantly.  
* **Privacy:** Keep your inputs and results off the cloud.  
* **Customization:** Use models and prompts that [fit your own workflow](https://appflowy.com/blog/Build-a-Digital-Workflow-for-Your-Team-With-AppFlowy).  
* **Reduced breach risk:** Avoid exposing sensitive information to third-party platforms.  
* **Hardware independence:** Works directly on your laptop, server, or device of choice.

AppFlowy makes this easy by supporting local AI right out of the box. With a simple setup using tools like Ollama, you can connect popular models to your digital workspace and get started in minutes. This efficient solution eliminates the need for cloud infrastructure, reducing risks and increasing control.

## Digital Workspace You Can Build Without Writing Code

You shouldn't need to be a developer to take advantage of powerful tools. AppFlowy's no-code structure lets you build a digital workspace where AI features fit seamlessly into your workflow and adapt as your tasks evolve. Whether you're setting up your first digital workspace or refining an existing one, AppFlowy makes the process smooth and accessible. 

Here's a quick list of how anyone, tech-savvy or not, can create something powerful:

1. **Modular Setup:** Add only the tools you need without unnecessary clutter.  
2. **Drag-and-Drop Customization:** Organize tasks, notes, and views visually—no code required.  
3. **Template Library:** Start with ready-made layouts or tweak your own to fit specific needs.  
4. **Built-in AI Connections:** Link local models directly to writing and planning tools.  
5. **Shared Workspaces:** Collaborate with team members in real time or offline.  
6. **Open Source Flexibility:** Adapt your workspace to include applications or integrations you value.

With AppFlowy, your [digital workspace](https://appflowy.com/blog/Using-Workspace-Management-Software-to-Build-Your-Own-System) becomes something you can mold and manage without ever touching code. It's flexible enough for teams and simple enough for individuals, so you can focus on what matters instead of learning a new programming language.

No matter the size of your team or the complexity of your tasks, AppFlowy ensures that your digital workspace is scalable, secure, and tailored to your needs. You can turn your digital workspace into a central hub for everything—plans, ideas, notes, and automation.

## AI Speeds Up Processes Without Taking Control

AI should help you work faster, not make your decisions for you. With AppFlowy, AI speeds up processes by reducing manual steps but keeping you in control.

Here's a quick comparison:

| Without AI | With AppFlowy Local AI |
| ----- | ----- |
| Manually summarize meetings | Summarize instantly from notes |
| Create plans from scratch | Turn bullet lists into structured project outlines |
| Edit long content manually | Use AI suggestions without losing your voice |

AI is here to support your flow, not replace your judgment. It learns from how you use it and adapts accordingly, without sending your data away for processing. That way, AI speeds up processes while respecting your role in decision-making.

When used intentionally, AI speeds up processes without causing chaos. Instead of introducing confusion or bottlenecks, it enhances clarity and boosts momentum. If you need to deliver results faster, smarter, and more confidently, AI speeds up processes so you can meet goals with ease. Teams using AppFlowy find that AI speeds up processes not only in text generation but in task planning and document creation, too.

You gain the benefits of artificial intelligence without losing oversight. Whether you're a content creator or part of a larger team, AppFlowy's integration ensures AI speeds up processes while keeping control in your hands.

## How to Set Up a Vault Workspace That Stays Yours

Too often, we hand over our data without realizing it. But with a vault workspace, you keep control of your content from day one. AppFlowy is built to prioritize data privacy and ownership from the ground up.

Follow these steps to build your own:

### Step 1: Download AppFlowy

Get started by installing the desktop version for your platform. No registration or login required.

### Step 2: Add Local AI via Ollama

Use Ollama to run models like Llama 3 or Mistral 7B on your machine, without cloud dependency. This avoids unnecessary data transfer and addresses growing concerns about cloud-based models.

### Step 3: Create Your Vault Workspace

Create your own views and workflows to suit your style. Whether you're focused on content analysis or need insights for planning, your vault workspace adjusts to your needs.

### Step 4: Stay in Control

Run AI offline, and know exactly where your content lives. Maintain control over your data and ensure sensitive information never leaves your device.

By combining AppFlowy's local-first design with open-source flexibility, you get a vault workspace that doesn't compromise. Whether you're working solo or across a team, everything stays within your walls. You can build a vault workspace that aligns with your needs, update it regularly, and trust that your information remains safe. A well-configured vault workspace is more than a tool—it's a foundation for [long-term productivity](https://appflowy.com/blog/Tired-of-Productivity-Stacks-Use-This-Open-Source-App) and peace of mind. With AppFlowy, creating a vault workspace that respects your preferences and autonomy has never been easier. It's your content, your rules, inside your vault workspace.
