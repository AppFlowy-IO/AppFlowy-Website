Hey there,

We're wrapping up May with loads of exciting updates 😇

### 🔍 Meet AppFlowy AI Workspace Search* on desktop & mobile

Quickly find pages by titles, keywords, or natural-language questions

### ✨ AI Overviews in Search

Ask a question and get an instant AI-generated summary with source links, inspired by Google’s AI Overviews.

Note:
1. You’ll need to open old pages in the latest release to trigger indexing and make them searchable
2. Content inside database pages isn’t searchable yet, but we’re working on it. Automatic indexing for old pages is also coming, so you won’t need to open them one by one to make them searchable.

### 🔗 Copy link to invite

You can now invite collaborators to your workspace by simply sending them an invite link. No need to specify emails — sharing and joining just got easier.

### 🔢 Login with password

Another alternative way to login! It’s for people who are not a big fan of magic links.

### 📚 AppFlowy Prompt Library

Have you ever wondered whether your AI prompts are good enough to make the most of AI? We now provide a curated collection of ready-to-use prompts to help you unleash the power of AI inside AppFlowy.

These prompts cover a wide range of applications, including crafting compelling sales emails, generating engaging social media posts, developing persuasive product descriptions, and more.

### ✨ Use your own prompts

You can also load your own prompts and quickly access them from the prompt library.

### 🔔 The desktop in-app notification gets a new look

Easier to use, more joyful to read. You can now archive notifications or mark them as read.

### 🔥 Upcoming releases
* Mention a person: @someone in documents and databases
* [AppFlowy Web](https://appflowy.com) : the ability to edit Grid and Kanban (ETA: June)
* Pro Plan only
+ Vault: a new type of workspace that’s private and offline. AI runs locally with no data transfer 🔐
+ Guest editing: invite non-members to collaborate on a page (with more cursors jumping together)

Until next time,

The AppFlowy Team
