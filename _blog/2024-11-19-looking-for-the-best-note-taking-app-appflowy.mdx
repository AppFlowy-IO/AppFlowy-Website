*Find the perfect note-taking app by focusing on these essential features for an enhanced experience \- we've been talking to users for years for this list\!*

You've got your stack of apps figured out, except for one crucial piece: finding a note-taking app that actually works the way you need it to. If you're like most users we've talked to, you've probably tried [Notion](https://appflowy.io/compare/notion-vs-appflowy), experimented with Apple Notes, or cycled through countless free note-taking apps trying to find the perfect fit.

But here's what we've learned after years of conversations with power users: the features that look impressive in marketing materials aren't always the ones that matter in day-to-day use. What really counts? Data ownership, offline reliability, and the freedom to work your way.

Let’s look at the *truly* essential features you should evaluate when choosing a note-taking app in 2025\. We'll cover everything from basic necessities to advanced capabilities that can transform your workflow:

* Why offline support matters more than you might think
* The real impact of open-source vs. closed-source on your data
* How cross-platform support affects your daily workflow
* What to look for in AI features (beyond the buzzwords)
* Performance considerations for large-scale note collections

Whether you're a Mac user looking for the best note-taking app for your workflow, or you need something that works seamlessly across all your devices, this feature-focused guide will help you make an informed decision.

*We'll be honest \- [we built AppFlowy](https://appflowy.io/), and we think it's the best note taking app out there\! But we know that everyone has unique needs for their personal productivity \- which is why this guide reflects our broader industry expertise and conversations with thousands of users about what actually matters in a note-taking app.*

*Our goal? To help you understand the key features that will impact your daily experience.*

## The Evolution of Note Taking: Why We Keep Switching Apps

Remember when note-taking was simple? You had a notebook, a pen, and your thoughts. Today, we're drowning in options. Each new note-taking app promises to revolutionize how we think, work, and organize our lives. Yet somehow, many of us find ourselves in an endless cycle:

1. Get excited about a new app's fancy features
2. Spend hours setting up our "perfect" system
3. Use it religiously... for about two weeks
4. Gradually drift back to basic tools
5. Repeat with the next promising app

Sound familiar?

### The Real Problem Isn't You—It's the Tools

The truth is most note-taking apps fall into two problematic categories:

**Too Basic:** Like Apple Notes or traditional text editors. They're reliable and simple, but they lack the powerful features you need to truly organize and connect your thoughts.

**Too Complex:** Think Notion and its closed-source alternatives. They offer everything under the sun—databases, widgets, embeds, and integrations. But this power comes at a cost: complexity, performance issues, and often, a feeling that you're building a digital palace you'll never actually live in.

### Why We Keep Going Back to Basics

When faced with too much complexity, we often retreat to what we know works:

* Physical notebooks that never crash
* Simple text files that always open
* Excel spreadsheets that just get the job done

We do this because these tools offer something crucial that many modern note-taking apps don't: **reliability and control**. They might not be perfect, but they're:

* Always available
* Never too slow
* Completely within our control
* Simple to understand

### Breaking the Cycle

But settling for basic tools means missing out on the genuine benefits of modern note-taking:

* Connected thoughts and ideas
* Powerful search capabilities
* Collaboration features
* AI assistance
* Cross-device synchronization

The good news? You don't have to choose between simplicity and power. The key is focusing on the right features—ones that enhance your workflow without overwhelming it. Modern note-taking should feel like an extension of your brain, not a second job.

After years of watching users cycle through apps, we've identified what makes a note-taking app "sticky"—one you'll actually stick with long-term:

* It works reliably offline
* It starts up instantly
* You own your data
* It's powerful when you need it, invisible when you don't
* It grows with you without growing complex

Now, let's look at these essential features in detail. Because understanding what matters (and what doesn't) is the first step to finding a note-taking app you'll actually use—not just another shiny object to add to your digital graveyard.

## The Features To Look For In The Best Note Taking Apps

## Data Control & Privacy Features

You've spent years building your digital brain—thousands of notes, projects, and ideas.

Then, one morning, you wake up to find that your note-taking app is having an outage. Or worse, they've changed their pricing model, and your data is now behind a higher paywall. Or perhaps most concerning, you discover they're using your notes to train their AI models without your express permission.

This isn't a hypothetical scenario—it's happened to users of major note-taking platforms repeatedly. The truth is, in our rush to embrace powerful features, we've somehow accepted that losing control of our data is just part of the deal.

True data control isn't just about being able to export your notes (though that's important). It's about having fundamental guarantees about how your information is handled and accessed. Here's what matters:

And we get it \- when you're looking for a paid or free note taking app, you aren't always interested in security features. You just want a system that works for you\! But you risk a lot when you don't know if your note apps are handling your data with integrity.

### Open Source Transparency

With open source software, you're not just trusting marketing promises—you can see exactly how your data is handled, with every line of code open to community verification and security auditing. No more wondering about hidden tracking or unexpected data collection.

### Self-Hosting Options

Self-hosting puts you in complete control of your infrastructure, allowing you to keep sensitive data within your organization and scale your setup without surprising cost increases. It's the difference between renting and owning your digital home.

### Local-First Architecture

A local-first approach means your data lives on your device, not in someone else's cloud. You decide when to sync, how to sync, and whether to sync at all—your notes are always accessible, internet or not.

### AI on *Your* Terms

Modern AI features shouldn't mean sacrificing privacy. You should be able to choose your AI models, control what data they can access, and never worry about your personal notes being used for training without your explicit consent. You can choose to self-host AppFlowy or use our cloud services as needed, allowing you to control your data's location and usage.

More importantly, we believe this level of control should be the industry standard, not a premium feature. The best features in the world don't matter if you can't trust what's happening with your data. Start here, then build up to evaluating other capabilities.

## Accessibility & Reliability Features

You know that moment when inspiration strikes—maybe it's during a flight, in the middle of a meeting, or while you're reviewing last month's project notes.

But instead of *capturing* that thought, you're staring at a loading spinner, dealing with sync conflicts, or worse, completely locked out of your notes because you're offline. And just like that, the idea’s *gone.*

The most powerful note-taking app in the world is useless if you can't access it when you need it. Somehow, we've normalized waiting for our thoughts to load.

Here are some of those features that other note taking apps might not take seriously enough:

### Cross-Platform Availability

Your ideas don't care what device you're using. Whether you're on Linux, Mac, Windows, or mobile, your note-taking experience should be consistent and native to each platform—not just a web wrapper that kind of works when your browser isn't overwhelmed.

### Genuine Offline Support

Real offline support isn't just a read-only mode when you lose connection. It means full functionality whether you're in airplane mode, in a basement office, or choosing to work unplugged.

Your entire workspace should be available and fully functional – sync status irrelevant.

### Performance at Scale

The true test of a note-taking app isn't how it handles your first 100 notes—it's how it performs when you've built up years of knowledge. Your app should scale with your ideas, maintaining speed and reliability whether you're managing 10 notes or 10,000.

### Device-Native Experience

A proper native app doesn't just mean faster performance—it means respecting your device's features, shortcuts, and design patterns. Your note-taking should feel like a natural extension of your operating system, not a foreign element fighting against it.

[AppFlowy is built around native apps for every major platform](https://appflowy.io/download) - ensuring you get genuine offline functionality and native performance everywhere. Our local-first approach means your data is instantly available, and our native apps respect platform-specific design patterns and shortcuts.

Even those huge notebooks stay responsive because we process data locally, avoiding the latency and bottlenecks of constant server communication.

## User Experience & Productivity

Here's the big one \- how well does the note taking app work? A note app can quickly be passed over if it doesn't have that UI and UX that draws you into *wanting* to make a to-do list\!

But while pretty interfaces are nice, true user experience is about how smoothly you can capture and organize your thoughts without breaking your flow.

While tools like Apple Notes may not have the flashiest look and feel, you'll find that many go back to apps with basic features because the actual use is *just so smooth\!*

So, what should you look for in the user experience of note taking apps? Here are some of the big ones we've found \- and ones that we built AppFlowy to offer as well:

### Markdown and Shortcuts

Markdown isn't just for developers anymore—it's about keeping your hands on the keyboard and your mind on your ideas.

A proper implementation means you can format text naturally while typing, use keyboard shortcuts that make sense, and never have to reach for your mouse just to make a heading or create a list. At AppFlowy, we give you the power of customization – you can create custom shortcuts for your most common function from within the settings.

### Data Visualization Flexibility

Your notes aren't just blocks of text—they're interconnected ideas that need different views. Being able to switch between document views, tables, boards, and calendars isn't about having more features—it's about seeing your information in whatever way makes the most sense for the task at hand.

### True Customization

Real customization goes beyond changing colors and themes. It means being able to adapt your workspace to your thinking style, whether that's customizing keyboard shortcuts, adjusting your layout for right-to-left languages, or setting up your own organizational system that matches how your brain works.

### Smart Defaults, Flexible Options

Ever feel like you need a Ph.D just to figure out how to use the basic features of a software tool? You shouldn't have to spend hours setting up basic functionality, but you should have the power to tweak things when necessary.

These are the big features that note taking software must have to stand out. That's why we built our editor to support natural Markdown while typing, with keyboard shortcuts that feel intuitive across all platforms.

[Our block-based system](https://appflowy.io/appflowy-blocks) lets you switch between different view types (documents, boards, tables) without losing data, and everything from fonts to layouts can be customized to match your workflow. But most importantly, it all works out of the box—customization is there when you want it, not required to get started.

## AI Integration

You know we had to include this one. AI in note-taking apps has become like a game of feature checklist bingo—everyone claims to have it, but few implement it in ways that actually enhance your workflow.

Seriously, we put in “AI note taking apps” in Google (which *also* uses AI now), and here’s what it gave us:

* Notion (AI assistant for meeting transcription and summaries)
* Evernote (AI-powered search across documents and images)
* Fireflies.AI (automatic transcription of conversations and meetings)
* Otter.ai (AI note-taking tool for recording audio and capturing meeting points)
* Reflect (AI-enhanced notes with "second brain" features)
* Microsoft OneNote (note-taking app with audio recording capabilities)
* Mem (AI-powered note organization and knowledge base creation)
* Fathom (AI notetaker specifically for Zoom calls)

Great \- so you have all the features you need… but spread across eight different platforms? *Goodbye, RAM.*

The real question isn't whether an app has AI features, but whether those features give you more control over your notes or less.

As we covered in our data privacy feature section above, you want to know that your task management data isn't being used to feed power-hungry learning models (especially if you include details about your personal life\!)

Here at AppFlowy, we aren't anti-AI. In fact, we think that AI has incredible potential to turn basic sticky notes or text notes into highly detailed notes that you can interact with and learn from.

We believe that the best note-taking apps use the best AI solutions available today \- and should utilize the latest versions as they’re released. Here are the key AI features that you'll want your notes app to include:

### Model Choice and Control

AI isn't one-size-fits-all. Sometimes, you need the power of GPT-4 for complex analysis; other times, you want a local model for private brainstorming; occasionally, you might not want AI touching your data at all.

True AI integration means having the freedom to choose the right tool for the moment, not being locked into whatever model the app provider chose for you.

### Privacy-Conscious Implementation

Your notes often contain sensitive information—personal thoughts, business strategies, private conversations. AI features should enhance your note-taking without requiring you to share your entire knowledge base with third-party servers. You should be able to decide exactly what data your AI assistant can see and use.

### Practical, Not Just Powerful

AI should solve real problems: summarizing long documents, extracting action items from meeting notes, helping you reorganize information, or providing writing assistance when you need it. But it should do so in ways that fit naturally into your workflow, not as a separate tool you have to context-switch to use.

### Transparent Operation

We designed our AI integration to put you in control. Run local models like Mistral 7B directly on your machine for complete privacy, or choose cloud providers like GPT-4 or Claude when you need more power. Plus, by deeply integrating AI into your existing workflows, you keep AI right where you need it, when you need it.

[AI features are integrated naturally into the editor](https://docs.appflowy.io/docs/appflowy/product/appflowy-x-openai)—highlight text for instant summaries, ask for writing suggestions, or extract tasks from notes. But importantly, you always know what's happening with your data, and you can work completely offline with local models when privacy is paramount.
