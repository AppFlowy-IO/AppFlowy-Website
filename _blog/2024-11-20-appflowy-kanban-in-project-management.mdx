The immersion of remote work has changed the game and allowed for a workspace that includes employees from all over the world—yet managing projects from different time zones can throw a wrench in things. Project management tools are non-negotiable for teams handling complex tasks and working around tight deadlines, which is exactly why we’ve created Kanban. Offering a visual approach to task management means that Kanban simplifies processes, creates a more collaborative environment, and allows team members to visually see project timelines. As an added bonus, the team at AppFlowy has integrated a Kanban feature that empowers teams to organize, track, log, and update project tasks in real time, making everything more transparent.

### **The Benefits of Kanban in Project Management**

At its core, Kanban uses boards, lists, and cards to represent and manage tasks visually, giving teams an at-a-glance overview of project status. Take a look at a few of the many benefits of using Kanban in [project management](https://appflowy.io/templates/project-management):

1. **Task Organization**: Kanban boards make it simple to organize tasks into categories like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.”
2. **Flexibility**: Unlike traditional project management methods, Kanban is designed for continuous delivery and improvement. Teams are able to pivot, adjust priorities, and add or rearrange tasks on the fly without disrupting the workflow.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Visualizing tasks allows managers to quickly pick up on bottlenecks and redistribute resources, so that deadlines remain achievable.

### **Enhancing Collaboration in Projects with Kanban**

We all know that collaboration is at the heart of every successful project, but making space for continuous communication isn’t always easy. With teams often dispersed across different locations, it’s more important than ever to have a tool that facilitates real-time communication and teamwork. AppFlowy’s Kanban feature is designed to support collaboration by enabling team members to share quick updates as needed. In a nutshell, it makes collaboration accessible.

#### **Updates for Coordination in Real-Time**

We believe that time is money at AppFlowy and our Kanban in project management reflects that. In a more traditional work setting, team members rely on frequent meetings or long email chains to stay updated, which can be a time-waster. Instead, Kanban simplifies this by allowing for real-time updates that don’t require a specific time commitment. As tasks progress, team members can immediately update the status or add notes to the task card, allowing everyone involved to stay informed without the unnecessary additional meetings.

### **Improving Project Visibility for Team Alignment**

What truly sets Kanban apart is its ability to bring transparency and visibility to every single project stage. AppFlowy’s Kanban lets everyone on the team have access to the same information, so that no one is left in the dark. Project visibility is an aspect that is often overlooked but we believe it makes the biggest difference when it comes to output.

#### **Ensuring Alignment with Project Goals and Deadlines**

For more complex projects, staying aligned with goals and deadlines isn’t just a want—it’s a need. When using Kanban, teams can see a visual representation of each task’s progress, making it easier to stay focused on high-priority items and adjust as needed. AppFlowy’s Kanban boards show exactly where each project stage stands, keeping team members accountable and aware of approaching deadlines. This eliminates surprises and allows for a greater sense of clarity.

#### **Checklists for Smarter Planning**

Kanban also offers support checklists so that teams are able to break down tasks into smaller, more digestible pieces. This feature is particularly useful for projects with multiple moving parts, where delays in one area could throw off the task as a whole. Being able to see these checklists visually means that teams can quickly identify what comes next, so that bumps in the road are kept to a minimum.

### **Optimizing the Project Management Workflow with Kanban**

Kanban’s ability to streamline project management makes it a valuable asset for any team, regardless of size or industry. Even if your business runs on a small but mighty crew, Kanban will change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis. If you aren’t sure where to start, check out our [Simple Project Board](https://appflowy.io/templates/kanban/ab3ccd92-47ab-4ef2-be09-873edf4293a7) and [Eisenhower Matrix](https://appflowy.io/templates/project-management/d9085311-1d32-426f-95d4-1e2db3b64fbe), both of which are ideal for getting organized. 

#### **Visualizing Workflow**

In a dynamic project setting, it’s common for priorities to shift on the drop of a dime. Kanban’s visual layout lets teams respond to these changes by simply moving task cards to new categories or reassigning team members. Because of this flexibility, everyone is able to work on the most relevant tasks at the time, adapting their efforts to meet ever-evolving project requirements.

**Multiple Views**

Another powerful aspect of Kanban is the ability to view datasets from multiple vantage points. By changing up the view, users can tweak the way they visualize data, which is particularly helpful for projects that involve many different team members.

### **Final Thoughts**

Having a reliable project management tool makes all the difference when it comes to collaborating with your employees—no matter where they are in the world. [AppFlowy’s Kanban](https://appflowy.io/templates/kanban) feature helps teams streamline their workflow and stay in alignment when it comes to goals.
