A digital workflow only works if it fits how your team actually works. That’s why [36% of organizations already use business process management tools to automate workflows](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-imperatives-for-automation-success)—they want systems that work the way they do and help reduce time spent on manual processes.

AppFlowy makes that possible. It’s one of the most adaptable workflow management solutions and automation software tools available today. With blocks, templates, and flexible views, you can build a digital workflow that fits your team, not the other way around. It helps simplify how you work by turning manual steps into repeatable digital processes—no complicated software needed.

In this blog, you’ll learn how to set project priorities, choose the right tools inside AppFlowy, and use workflow templates to create a setup that works. Whether you're launching a new process, adopting new tools, or managing multiple teams, clearly defined project priorities help everything stay on track.

## Defining a Digital Workflow That Fits How You Work

The best digital workflow doesn’t come from copying someone else’s system. It comes from understanding how your team communicates and collaborates. AppFlowy makes this easier with flexible building blocks that can adapt to your style.

You might like to work with Kanban boards. Someone else may prefer a simple list. Some teams plan everything upfront. Others work better by adjusting as they go. With AppFlowy, you don’t have to choose one method. You can build your digital process around how your team naturally works—without limits.

Whether you’re managing a design sprint, running a product roadmap, or coordinating daily standups, you can create a structure that supports how people work, not one that changes how they work.

AppFlowy stands out from other workflow management solutions by helping you replace manual tasks, reduce inefficiency, and streamline processes. It's ideal for teams that need structure without losing flexibility.

## Workflow Management Solutions for New Users

AppFlowy is simple to use, even if you’ve never built a system before. It’s designed to support creators, developers, and teams who want more control over their tools. With its open-source nature and modular architecture, AppFlowy makes it easy to shape your setup exactly how you want it.

Here’s how to get started with its core features:

### Step 1: Start with pages

AppFlowy offers several page types to choose from: Document, Grid, Kanban, Calendar, and AI Chat. The Document type supports rich content blocks—text, to-dos, code, callouts, Kanban boards, linked calendars—all of which you can move, edit, and group however you like.

### Step 2: Choose your view

AppFlowy lets you switch between a Grid view, Kanban view, and more. You can pick the view that makes the most sense for your business operations or team setup. This flexibility is key when you want to go digital without changing your workflows.

### Step 3: Make it yours

Want a daily planner, a bug tracker, or a campaign checklist? You can build all of that inside one workspace. Customize it to fit your goals, whether you're handling incident reports, managing human resources, or onboarding a new employee.

### Step 4: Share and collaborate

Once your structure is set, invite your team. Everyone can work together in real time, using the same layout. It’s a great way to streamline communication, especially with remote work setups. AppFlowy makes it easier to spot what’s slowing work down and keeps everyone in sync when tasks need review or sign-off.

This setup gives you a flexible but strong foundation—a digital workflow that actually helps you manage work instead of creating more of it.

## Define Project Priorities Before You Build Anything

Setting project priorities early gives your system direction and clarity. It ensures that your team knows what matters most before jumping into task setup or choosing a layout. With clear goals, it becomes easier to assign responsibilities, allocate time, and track key metrics.

Without this step, even the most flexible tools like AppFlowy can become cluttered and confusing. Your workflow might grow in the wrong direction, wasting time and effort—even if you're using the best workflow management solutions or software programs available.

Here’s why it matters:

**Pros of defining project priorities first:**

- Keep your team focused on the right goals.
- Helps you decide what structure and features you need.
- Makes it easier to communicate progress to others.
- Reduces the chance of rework or missed deadlines.

**Cons of skipping this step:**

- Tasks pile up without a clear order.
- You might build a system that doesn’t reflect your actual needs.
- Team members may get pulled in different directions.

Before you use any workflow templates or start adding blocks, take time to audit your current setup. What are you trying to finish this week? What does success look like for this project? Use those answers to guide the setup of your digital workflow in AppFlowy. Keeping your project priorities front and center makes it easier to adjust your system as needs change.

This small step gives your team a big advantage and helps optimize your processes from day one.

## Customize with Workflow Templates That Save Time

AppFlowy offers templates you can use right away, or you can create your own. Either way, workflow templates save time and help you avoid building from scratch every time. Here's a quick comparison:

| Option                           | What It Offers                                                          | Best For                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pre-built workflow templates** | Ready-to-use layouts for project management, content planning, and more | Teams who want to start fast with less setup           |
| **Template \+ tweaks**           | Start with a pre-built layout and adjust blocks or views                | Teams who want a balance between speed and flexibility |

Templates are one of the most valuable features within AppFlowy’s workflow management solutions. With the right workflow templates, you can set up systems quickly, based on your project priorities, save them, and reuse them as needed. This keeps your team moving faster and avoids wasting time on setup.
