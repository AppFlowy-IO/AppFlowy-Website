Different types of AI models are transforming how we work—helping us write better, summarize faster, plan smarter, and automate tasks with ease. 

In fact, [78% of global companies currently use AI, and 82% are either using or exploring AI in their operations in 2025](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/companies-using-ai). But choosing the right model depends on what you need to do. Some teams need fast, cloud-based AI tools. Others want local AI that they can control. The best approach? One that gives you options.

Let's explore how AI models work, how local and cloud options differ, and how to build custom AI solutions that work best for your team's flow, right inside AppFlowy.

## Types of AI Models That Help You Work Smarter

AI models are built on algorithms and statistical models designed to mimic aspects of human intelligence. They can be based on deep learning, machine learning, or hybrid approaches, and vary in how the model is trained or deployed.

Some models focus on supervised learning, where the AI learns from labeled data, while others apply unsupervised learning techniques to find patterns without human guidance.

The best AI for your work depends on the model architecture, the amount of data, and the type of AI tasks, like natural language processing, image classification, or conversational AI.

Choosing the right model can save you time and improve the quality of your work. Here are three popular types of AI models and what they do best:

* **GPT-4:** Great for in-depth writing, structured content generation, and long-form outputs. It works well for reports, blogs, and research summaries.  
* **Claude:** Excellent at summarizing long documents, offering fast responses, and understanding instructions clearly. It's ideal for quick overviews and task breakdowns.  
* **Llama 3:** A strong open-source option that can be customized for specific tasks. Perfect for businesses wanting to build their own solutions or run AI offline.

These types of AI models give teams options to boost productivity in writing, planning, automation, and more, especially when combined with powerful workflow + AI strategies.

## Why Local AI Can Give You More Control

Why do so many professionals prefer local AI? Because it offers more control, privacy, and performance flexibility. Local AI gives you the power to run models directly from your device or server, ensuring your data never leaves your system. You stay in charge of how your models behave and evolve. AppFlowy supports this approach with native local AI integration.

AppFlowy gives you the power to run local AI right from your device or server. That means no data leaves your system, and you stay in charge. Here's how local AI compares to cloud-hosted models:

| Aspect | Local AI (e.g., self-hosted with AppFlowy) | Cloud Hosted Model |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Data Privacy** | Full control, no third-party access | Data sent to external servers |
| **Speed** | Low-latency, especially offline | Can be fast, but network-dependent |
| **Cost** | One-time setup, no usage fees | Ongoing pay-per-use pricing |
| **Setup Difficulty** | Needs technical setup | Plug-and-play (via API keys) |
| **Best For** | Security-focused, offline teams | Fast deployments, quick tests |

With AppFlowy's support for both local AI and cloud models, you don't have to choose one forever—you can switch based on your preferred model type, whether you're working with large language models, deep neural networks, or even training data for niche AI projects.

## How to Build Custom AI Solutions for Your Tasks

AI is most useful when it fits your specific needs. That's where custom AI solutions come in. These custom AI solutions let you build smarter, more targeted workflows that align with your specific needs. With AppFlowy, you can [create your own workflows](https://appflowy.com/blog/Build-a-Digital-Workflow-for-Your-Team-With-AppFlowy) by setting prompts and choosing which model powers your task. Here's how to start:

### Step 1: Pick the AI Model

Choose from GPT-4, Claude, or a local model like Llama 3. AppFlowy's model-agnostic setup lets you connect what works best.

### Step 2: Create a Task-Specific Prompt

Tailor your instruction to match the task, like summarizing a meeting or drafting a quick update.

### Step 3: Save Your Prompt

Store your prompt in AppFlowy's built-in library to reuse it anytime without starting from scratch.

### Step 4: Choose Your Model for The Task

Select which model you want to run your saved prompt with—local or cloud-based.

### Step 5: Trigger it in Your Workspace

Launch the AI action directly within your writing board, task list, or doc view.

This flexibility makes it easy to scale custom AI solutions across departments—from marketing to engineering—while integrating them into your workflow + AI system. You can train and deploy AI models for tasks like content generation, document summarization, or even apply AI to optimize [scheduling and planning workflows](https://appflowy.com/blog/5-Workflow-Templates-That-Help-Remote-Teams-Stay-on-Track).

## What Makes Workflow and AI Work Together in Workspace

Connecting workflow + AI isn't just about plugging in a smart tool. It's about creating a system where tasks and AI enhance each other. Here are four essentials that make it work inside a [productivity workspace](https://appflowy.com/blog/Tired-of-Productivity-Stacks-Use-This-Open-Source-App) like AppFlowy:

### Task-Aware Prompts

Instead of a generic assistant, use prompts that match the type of work you're doing (like bug tracking, note summarizing, or content outlining).

### Built-in Triggers

With model support embedded into AppFlowy's pages and boards, your AI can act on tasks in real time.

### Switchable Models

Swap between types of AI models to find the one that responds best to each kind of request. This saves time and improves results.

### Unified Experience

No need to jump to a chatbot app—AI works directly in your workspace. That's the power of merging workflow + AI.

The result is smoother operations, faster thinking, and less manual work across your team—thanks to a unified workflow + AI foundation powered by modern AI technologies, including generative AI models, NLP models, and deep learning techniques inspired by the human brain.
