Repetitive tasks drain time, energy, and creativity. In fact, a recent survey reported that [90% of employees feel burdened by these kinds of tasks](https://www.information-age.com/productivity-pains-90-workers-repetitive-tasks-7347/). We've all spent hours reformatting the same kind of document, rewriting similar content, or manually setting up similar to-do lists. What if you could turn those patterns into an automated tool that works for you? That's exactly what a custom prompt can do.

In this blog, we'll walk you through how to build your own custom prompt to support your productivity. Whether you're generating content, planning projects, or organizing daily tasks, you'll learn how to build repeatable systems using tools like AppFlowy to power your AI workflow.

## Custom Prompt That Helps You Work the Way You Want

A custom prompt is a tailored instruction you give to an AI tool to perform a specific task based on your style, goals, and input. Think of it like giving your AI a reusable checklist or set of guidelines—whether it's generating product descriptions, drafting emails, or [turning notes into action steps](https://appflowy.com/blog/Do-You-Struggle-Taking-Meeting-Notes-Try-This-Easy-Fix).

For example:

- Marketers can use prompts to summarize reports or repurpose blog content.
- Product teams can write prompts that convert meeting notes into specs.
- Sales reps can auto-generate follow-up emails using contact details.

With tools like AppFlowy, storing these custom prompts directly in your workspace means your team can apply them again and again without starting from scratch.

This is where prompt engineering makes a difference. A well-structured prompt helps the AI understand the context, field, and complexity of your request. Whether you're using a GPT model or another agent, you can define clear instructions, select the right format, and specify how responses should be generated. This way, users benefit from accurate, relevant responses with less manual adjustment.

## How to Create Workflows That Run With Less Input From You

Building powerful flows from your custom prompts isn't hard. With just a few clear instructions and examples, you can start creating structured processes in no time. These prompt-powered flows allow you to automate common tasks while maintaining your personal or team's tone and style.

Here's how you can create workflows that save time and reduce manual work:

### Step 1: Identify Repetitive Tasks

Start by listing common tasks you do regularly, especially those involving writing, summarizing, or formatting.

### Step 2: Break Down the Pattern

What are the steps you take? What's the input? What's the ideal output?

### Step 3: Write the Custom Prompt

Structure your instruction clearly. Include what the AI should do and in what format.

### Step 4: Store and Reuse in AppFlowy

Keep prompts where you and your team can easily access them. AppFlowy lets you save and manage custom prompts within your workspace.

### Step 5: Tweak as You Go

Refine your custom prompt based on results. Great prompts evolve over time.

When you create workflows this way, you let your tools do more of the work and free up time for high-value thinking. Whether you're handling documentation, planning, or content strategy, it's easier to create workflows that match how you work best. You can create workflows for blog outlines, team onboarding checklists, or meeting follow-ups.

AppFlowy makes it easy to create workflows that are accessible to your whole team. Even better, you can create workflows that adapt over time as your needs change. With just a few tweaks, you can create workflows that feel custom-built for your exact role. And with the flexibility of a modern AI builder prompt, you can even update fields, labels, and response styles without rewriting from scratch.

## Training AI Models With the Content You Already Have

Using your existing notes, documents, and templates can boost the effectiveness of your prompts. Using them as a base gives your AI a strong starting point for learning. This makes training AI models easier and more accurate.

Here's how using current content to guide training AI models helps—and where to be cautious:

### Pros

- **Faster setup:** You don't have to start from zero.
- **More relevant results:** The AI understands your language, structure, and priorities.
- **Consistency:** Your tone and workflow stay the same across tasks.

### Cons

- **Overfitting:** Too much repetition might limit creativity.
- **Outdated material:** If your base content isn't current, your results might reflect that.

AppFlowy's built-in prompt storage allows you to test and adjust your custom prompt using your own team's content, making training AI models faster and more precise. Organizations can also measure the impact of their prompts as part of their training AI models' workflows, ensuring consistency across use cases. You can also use existing project documentation, FAQs, or templates as input when training AI models for new use cases.

When done right, training AI models with internal assets helps streamline how content is generated, reviewed, and reused. You can also track how your training AI models evolve over time by logging improvements in AI outputs. And by documenting what works, you build a [knowledge base](https://appflowy.com/blog/Why-You-Need-to-Create-a-Company-Knowledge-Base) that supports more efficient training AI models for future workflows. This method allows teams to create a custom prompt that reflects their company's standard voice, relevant topic patterns, and content complexity.

## Use AI for Process Automation You Can Actually Trust

When teams talk about building automation that they can actually rely on, trust becomes the foundation. That's why we need to explore how to use AI for process automation, you can actually trust, not just fast results, but dependable, repeatable outcomes that align with how people really work.

| Setup Time               | Long                   | Short               |
| Flexibility              | Low                    | High                |
| Human Oversight Required | Often                  | Less Frequent       |
| Learning Curve           | Steep                  | Simple              |
| Personalization          | Limited                | Custom-tailored     |
