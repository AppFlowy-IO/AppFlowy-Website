Modern work comes with a flood of tools, but more tools don’t always mean more productivity. In fact, endless
productivity stacks often slow you down and get in the way of actually getting things done.

And teams are
noticing: [79% of organizations report improved productivity after adopting open source software](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/LF%20Research/World%20of%20Open%20Source%20Global%20Spotlight%202023%20-%20Report.pdf?hsLang=en).
That’s a clear sign that the right tools — ones that are flexible, focused, and user-friendly — really do make a
difference.

AppFlowy is one of those tools. It’s a powerful, open-source workflow tool that brings everything your team needs into
one workspace. With an intuitive setup and room to customize, AppFlowy helps you manage your schedule, streamline
collaboration, and cut the chaos — so you can focus on work that matters.

## Why Productivity Stacks Are Draining Your Team’s Focus

Using multiple tools might seem like the best productivity approach, but it often backfires. When every task, note, and
update lives in a different app, your team spends more time navigating clutter than moving work forward. Countless apps
lead to confusion, missed updates, and a slow response to changing needs. It also makes it harder to prioritize,
schedule, and get things done efficiently.

That’s why more teams are choosing to simplify their tech stack and build one workspace that supports the way they
actually work.

**Why it hurts productivity:**

* Switching between apps adds unnecessary steps and distractions
* It increases mental fatigue and slows decision-making
* Updates get lost, and team members miss key context
* Training new team members becomes more difficult

Cluttered productivity stacks don’t help your team — they slow them down and fragment your workflow. Choosing a single,
adaptable workflow tool like AppFlowy brings everything together into one intuitive space.

## Replace the Clutter with One Workspace That Does It All

Managing work across five or more tools is exhausting. It can leave teams feeling scattered, disconnected, and
constantly catching up. Instead of solving problems, bloated productivity stacks often create more of them. That’s why
moving to one workspace — one that does everything your team needs — can be a game-changer.

Let’s look at the top reasons to simplify your setup and how one productivity app like AppFlowy can provide a real
advantage:

1. **Everything is in one place** – Tasks, notes, data, and team collaboration live in a single hub, making it easier to
   stay organized and keep track of everything.
2. **Faster work, fewer clicks** – Say goodbye to wasting time switching between tools. AppFlowy’s unified workspace
   helps you get things done without distraction.
3. **Easier onboarding** – New team members can learn one tool instead of five. This reduces training time and improves
   early engagement.
4. **Clearer communication** – Everyone works from the same source of truth, so there’s less confusion and fewer missed
   updates.
5. **Lower costs** – By replacing multiple subscriptions with one open-source solution, teams can significantly reduce
   overhead while gaining better integration and control.

AppFlowy makes it possible to replace five tools with one workspace built around your needs — a flexible, simple
workflow software that adapts to you. It’s self-hosted, open-source, and built for teams who want control without
complexity. As a workflow tool, AppFlowy supports deep customization without bloat.

## Simple Workflow Software Should Feel Effortless

AppFlowy makes it easy for teams to cut through tool overload and build focused, flexible workflows. It’s a practical
strategy to help you manage tasks, keep track of your schedule, and get things done with fewer distractions. Instead of
jumping between apps for notes, tasks, and planning, you can bring everything together in one place — tailored exactly
to how your team works.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started with AppFlowy and build your ideal workspace:

### Step 1: Create your workspace

Set up your AppFlowy environment to include everything you need — tasks, notes, databases, and more — all in one place.

### Step 2: Customize your layout

Use flexible building blocks to shape your workspace around how your team works best. Whether you need Kanban boards,
tables, or rich text notes, AppFlowy supports it.

### Step 3: Collaborate in real-time

Invite your team and start working together instantly. Updates are shared live, so everyone stays in sync without
switching apps.

### Step 4: Host it your way

AppFlowy is self-hosted, giving you full control over your data. It’s a secure and private way to manage your workflows
without depending on third-party servers.

With AppFlowy, simple workflow software means more than just fewer clicks — it’s a workflow tool designed to match your
exact needs and grow with your team.

## Pick a Workflow Tool That Works the Way You Do

Every team has its own way of working. Some teams follow structured workflows, while others are more flexible and
creative. The challenge is finding a workflow tool that can support both styles — without forcing you to change how you
work. AppFlowy is built with this in mind.

AppFlowy lets you customize your workspace to fit your exact needs with an intuitive interface that doesn’t require a
steep learning curve. You can choose how you organize tasks, notes, and data. It brings the benefits of simple workflow
software to your fingertips, giving your team a clear, focused way to get work done.

Unlike many productivity stacks that demand you adapt to their structure, AppFlowy fits into your existing workflow.
Whether you're running product sprints or planning creative campaigns, AppFlowy adapts to your team, not the other way
around. It helps teams prioritize their work and craft workflows that feel natural and enjoyable. It’s a workflow tool
that brings clarity and control to even the most complex projects.

This is the value of simple workflow software: it fits your flow instead of forcing a new one. When you're not weighed
down by complex productivity stacks, everything becomes easier. And when everything is in one workspace, your team works
faster, communicates better, and stays in control.
