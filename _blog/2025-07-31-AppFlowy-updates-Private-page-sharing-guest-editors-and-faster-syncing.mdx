Hey there,

We're kicking off July with major app updates (v0.9.4) 🚀

🔐 **Private page sharing**
You can now add members by email to private pages with **Can View** or **Can Edit** permissions.

**✨ Add non-members (guests) to individual pages (Pro Plan only)**
Invite non-members (guest editors) to your Pro Plan workspace to collaborate on your pages in real time. Guests get **page access** instead of full workspace access.

**👯** **Shared with me**

Browse all pages shared with you under the new **Shared with me** section in the sidebar. View/Edit shared pages using AppFlowy Mobile 📱

🔄 **New syncing protocol**

After a year of hard work, we've just completed a new syncing protocol optimized for faster, more reliable multi-user and multi-device data sync. Its rollout paves the way for long-awaited collaboration features like version history and push notifications. We'll also resume database iteration and fix related bugs.

Many exciting updates are coming soon!

🔥 **Upcoming releases**

- Mention a person: @someone in documents
- AppFlowy Web: login with password, AI prompt library
- Vault (a new type of workspace): private and offline—AI runs locally, no data transfer _(paid add-on)_

Until next time,  
The AppFlowy Team
