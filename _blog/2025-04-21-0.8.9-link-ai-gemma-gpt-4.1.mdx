Hey there,

We're excited to share AppFlowy’s April updates with you!

This month, we’ve made link improvements, supported OTP login, and brought in new AI models.

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuAs-knFhrI" alt="Login with OTP" />

## Login with OTP

We know some of you can't sign in with your corporate email using the magic link. We've added some alternatives 🔢

You can now log in with an OTP or paste the magic link directly into your browser.

## Links got revamped with new features 🔗

* Paste a link as a mention for a more condensed visualization of the content in the link
* Hover previews give you a quick glimpse of the linked content before clicking
* Easily convert between different link formats
* Editing links is now easier—and more enjoyable 😊

## AppFlowy Local AI (LAI) now runs on Linux, and it’s also available on macOS and Windows 💯

Get the power of AppFlowy + AI while keeping your data private and secure 🔐

✨ Gemma 3 is available in AppFlowy via Ollama. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/PfWy-jrQx34) to learn how to load
a new local model.

AppFlowy AI now supports GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet
Choose your preferred model in AI Chat to perform specific tasks. Learn how to switch models

## 😇 There’s more

* Adding an emoji to your sentence just got easier—simply use the colon (:) followed by the emoji name.

## 🛠️ What we’re working on:

* A revamped desktop in-app notification center
* AI custom prompts
* Password login
* Mobile workspace search
* Editing Grids and Kanbans in the [web app](http://appflowy.com) is now ETA’d for June 🚀
