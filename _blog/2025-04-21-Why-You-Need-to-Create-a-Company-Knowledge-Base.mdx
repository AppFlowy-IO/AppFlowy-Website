Imagine a workplace where employees waste hours searching for information, policies get lost in emails, and critical
knowledge disappears when team members leave. Without a structured system, businesses struggle to keep everyone aligned.

A company's information hub changes that. It ensures essential information is always accessible, making collaboration
easier and reducing confusion. In
fact, [knowledge bases can improve internal team productivity by 35% by streamlining information access](https://desku.io/stats-hub/knowledge-base-statistics/).
A self-hosted knowledge base takes this a step further, giving businesses full control over their data with enhanced
security and flexibility.

In this blog, we’ll explore how businesses can create a company knowledge base, improve sharing knowledge with team
members, and use a business process workflow to keep information structured and accessible.

## Why You Need to Create a Company Knowledge Base

A well-structured system helps teams store and retrieve data easily. Without it, employees waste time searching for
documents, policies, or important guidelines. Here are five key reasons to create a company knowledge base:

1. **Reduces Time Waste** – Employees can quickly find answers, reducing repeated questions and inefficiencies.
2. **Ensures Consistency** – Everyone has access to the same data, maintaining uniformity across the company.
3. **Improves Onboarding** – New employees can access a single source of truth, speeding up the learning process.
4. **Supports Remote Work** – A centralized system ensures team members, regardless of location, can collaborate
   effectively.
5. **Preserves Institutional Knowledge** – Valuable insights and expertise remain documented, even when employees leave
   the company.

Following best practices in information management helps businesses create content that is well-organized and easy to
use, ultimately helping them create a company knowledge base that is efficient and accessible. This structured system
ensures employees and customers can find the information they need quickly, improving overall efficiency and
decision-making.

## The Benefits of Sharing Knowledge with Team Members

Sharing knowledge with team members creates a stronger, more efficient workplace. By making information easily
accessible, businesses can foster better teamwork and reduce time spent searching for critical data. Below is a list of
key benefits:

* **Better Decision-Making:** Employees make informed choices with quick access to relevant information.
* **Increased Productivity:** Less time spent searching for information means more time focused on tasks.
* **Stronger Collaboration:** Team members can work together more effectively with shared information.
* **Employee Growth:** Learning from documented information helps employees develop skills and expertise.
* **Improved Customer Support:** When teams have access to the right information, they can resolve customer issues
  faster.

Having a well-documented, self-hosted knowledge base allows teams to access the information they need quickly, reducing
miscommunication and improving workflow efficiency. By sharing knowledge with team members, businesses can streamline
decision-making, strengthen collaboration, and improve customer satisfaction. Following best practices ensures a more
connected workplace, enhancing the user experience and making it easy for teams to find solutions to common challenges.

## How a Self-Hosted Knowledge Base Improves Data Security

Data security is a top concern for businesses. A self-hosted knowledge base offers several advantages over cloud-based
solutions. Below is a comparison of cloud-based and self-hosted systems:

| Feature           | Cloud-Based System                              | Self-Hosted System                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Control**  | Limited control over data                       | Full control over company data                                                                                     |
| **Security**      | Security depends on provider                    | Data encryption, customizable access controls, and easier alignment with compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)  |
| **Customization** | Limited customization                           | Highly customizable based on needs                                                                                 |
| **Cost**          | Ongoing subscription fees                       | [One-time or lower long-term costs](https://appflowy.com/blog/How-Self-Hosted-Collaboration-Software-Reduce-Costs) |
| **Risk Exposure** | Higher risk of third-party breaches and outages | Reduced exposure to external threats; data stays within your infrastructure                                        |

With a self-hosted knowledge base, businesses can tailor security settings, ensure compliance, and protect sensitive
data. AppFlowy provides an open-source solution, giving organizations full control over their internal knowledge
management while helping businesses save time and maintain better data protection.

## Using a Business Process Workflow to Organize Information
