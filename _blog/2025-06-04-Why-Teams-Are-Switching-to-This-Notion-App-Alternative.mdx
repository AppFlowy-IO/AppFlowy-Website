More teams are rethinking how they work, especially as collaboration increases and data privacy at work becomes more
important. [Notion leads the collaborative workspace market with an 83.38% share but struggles to meet every team’s needs](https://6sense.com/tech/collaborative-workspaces/notion-market-share)
—especially in areas like wiki, note-taking, and task management. As teams grow, many find they need more control,
customization, and ownership.

That’s why more teams are moving toward tools like AppFlowy—built with scale, security, and flexibility in mind. It
offers local data storage, privacy-first features, and full control over how teams collaborate.

This blog looks at why teams are switching, what AppFlowy brings to the table, and how it compares to Notion in privacy,
flexibility, and local data storage.

## Notion App Alternative Built for Growing Teams

Whether you're managing tasks, taking notes, or planning projects, your tools need to scale with you. AppFlowy is not
only a Notion app alternative but also one of the best Notion alternatives for teams focused on flexibility and
security. With a wide feature set that includes markdown support, drag-and-drop blocks, and optional offline mode, it
stands out as a user-friendly solution for growing organizations. From project management to content creation, it
streamlines your workflow while maintaining full control of your workspace.

As teams expand, their workflows and expectations evolve. Tools that once seemed ideal may begin to feel limited. Many
teams using Notion reach a point where they need more flexibility and control, especially when working across multiple
functions or handling sensitive information. AppFlowy was built to support that growth while addressing the rising need
for data privacy at work.

Here are some key reasons why growing teams are actively turning to a powerful Notion app alternative like AppFlowy:

* **Scalability** – As teams grow, their processes evolve. AppFlowy provides a flexible foundation that adapts to more
  complex workflows.
* **Customization** – Unlike closed platforms, AppFlowy allows full customization thanks to its open-source structure.
* **Control** – AppFlowy puts teams in charge, letting them manage permissions, access, and changes on their terms.
* **Data Ownership** – With AppFlowy, you can choose to self-host and store data locally, giving your team peace of mind
  and autonomy.

These benefits make AppFlowy a great match for teams that are scaling up and need reliable, flexible team workspaces to
support their growth. When flexibility, control, and security become essential, AppFlowy steps in to meet those needs
head-on.

## Team Workspaces That Don’t Compromise on Control

For teams to thrive, they need a workspace that adapts to their workflow and respects their boundaries. Many tools
support collaboration, but few give teams true control over structure and data. That lack of flexibility—and lack of
control over data privacy at work—becomes a blocker to scaling effectively. AppFlowy changes that by giving teams the
ability to shape their team workspaces from the ground up.

To help you compare, here’s a quick look at how AppFlowy stacks up against Notion as a project management tool and
productivity tool when it comes to control, customization, and ownership:

| Feature              | Notion              | AppFlowy                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Customization**    | Limited by platform | Fully customizable (open-source)         |
| **Cloud dependency** | Requires cloud      | Local or self-hosted options             |
| **Team control**     | Platform-controlled | User-controlled                          |
| **Data storage**     | Cloud-only          | Self-hosted / cloud / local data storage |
| **Privacy**          | Vendor managed      | Privacy-first features                   |

When you manage a team, you need to know where your data lives and how it’s used. Team workspaces should give you full
control over access, workflows, and changes. AppFlowy offers control through open-source customization and optional
local hosting, helping teams build secure and tailored team workspaces. It gives your team the freedom to build the
workspace they actually need.

## Data Privacy at Work Should Not Be an Option

We live in a time when data is one of the most valuable assets a team has. Yet, many tools force teams to hand over
their information without a clear picture of where it's stored, how it's protected, or who ultimately has access. For
businesses that need to meet internal privacy standards or follow legal regulations, this lack of transparency and
control quickly becomes a major concern.

**The problem:** Cloud-based platforms often store your team’s data on external servers, beyond your control. Once
uploaded, it’s difficult to track who can access the information or ensure it’s being managed responsibly. This creates
uncertainty and risk for any team that prioritizes data privacy at work.

**The solution:** AppFlowy is designed with privacy at its core. It gives your team the option to self-host your
workspace and store data locally, so you maintain full control over your team workspaces. With privacy-first features,
AppFlowy helps you stay compliant, protect sensitive information, and build a more secure and trustworthy workflow.

As privacy concerns continue to rise, AppFlowy provides a practical, secure, and flexible alternative, without
compromising how your team collaborates. It's a better way to manage modern team workspaces with confidence and control.

## Local Data Storage Helps You Own Your Workspace

Teams are becoming more aware of where their data lives and who controls it. Cloud-only platforms often mean sacrificing
ownership and depending on a third party to keep everything secure. That’s not ideal, especially for organizations with
high standards for data integrity. With AppFlowy, storing your data securely isn’t an afterthought. It’s a core feature
designed to empower teams to take full control of their digital environment.

Here’s how to set up your Vault—a local-only workspace—with AppFlowy:

1. **Download and install AppFlowy** on your own system or private server. This helps you avoid depending on third-party
   hosting or vendors.
2. **Create and configure your workspace.** Choose the Vault type. Set up spaces, documents, and projects just like you
   would in any other collaborative tool.
3. **Customize the interface and workflows.** Tailor templates, layouts, and modules to fit the way you already work.
4. **Use local AI to boost your productivity.** Chat and write with local AI to get inspiration, draft, and polish your
   work. Private and offline—AI runs locally, with no data transfer.

As a Notion alternative focused on local-first infrastructure, AppFlowy helps teams break away from cloud-only
restrictions and reclaim ownership of their tools. It’s ideal for teams to streamline project management, simplifying
note-taking, and creating a second brain to organize their notes and documents. This shift toward local data storage
isn’t just about security—it’s about strengthening data privacy at work and giving teams ownership of their digital
environments. Teams want tools that support autonomy, reduce vendor lock-in, and build lasting workflows, with full
control over how and where their data is stored. That’s why more and more teams are switching from Notion to a tool like
AppFlowy.
