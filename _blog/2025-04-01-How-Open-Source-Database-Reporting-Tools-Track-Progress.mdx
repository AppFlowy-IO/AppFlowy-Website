Tracking progress is key to success in any business. Many businesses still rely on outdated, manual methods for tracking
progress, which can waste time and lead to
mistakes. [Around 19.86% of businesses rely on open-source analytics and reporting software solutions](https://www.openlogic.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/report-ol-state-of-oss-2024.pdf)

Here’s how a multi-project dashboard compares to traditional tracking methods:

| Feature             | Traditional Tracking       | Multi-Project Dashboard              |
|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Data Collection** | Manual entry               | Easy task updates in one place       |
| **Accuracy**        | Prone to human error       | Consistent and organized data        |
| **Collaboration**   | Difficult to share updates | Share updates within the team easily |
| **Customization**   | Limited formatting options | Fully customizable workspace         |
| **Efficiency**      | Time-consuming             | Saves time and reduces effort        |

With a multi-project dashboard, teams can maintain clarity, reduce confusion, and ensure smooth project execution.
