## My Experience Handling My First PR


In this section, I will highlight my personal experience with AppFlowy, from why I decided to contribute, the workflow that I followed, and the overall experience of going about Open-Source development.

### Why I Decided to Contribute to AppFlowy

My first contribution for AppFlowy came during the [GitHub Octernships](https://education.github.com/students/octernships?ref=blog.appflowy.io) season. I had heard about the GitHub Octernships through a promotional video that I had found on YouTube.

Considering how similar it was to GSOC and other Open Source initiatives, I was interested in trying it out. I registered for the event, and after careful consideration, decided to choose AppFlowy as one of my four entries.

The initial appeal of AppFlowy was clear, it was a productivity tool suite, competing with heavyweights like Notion and Todoist, and most importantly, it was Open Source in nature. That meant a third-year junior like myself could have a shot at development experience, without much hassle.

AppFlowy is built out of Flutter and Rust, which were completely new to me. However, considering the pros of the Octernships program, I decided to enroll anyway. I joined the AppFlowy Discord Server, introduced myself, and quickly got down to completing the assignment.

This brought me to handling a PR for any first-time issue for Junior Dev's. This was a compulsory part of the Octernships application, which officially started my Open Source journey with AppFlowy.

### Searching for My First Issue

I began by searching for issues on the main AppFlowy repository.

I had contributed to minor open-source projects before, and knew how one generally went about contributing to open-source repositories. I entered the words "good-first-issue" in the label bar and selected the first option, i.e., good first issues for junior devs.

This was my first time working with Flutter, so I decided it was best that I started out with something easy. I decided to go ahead with issue [#1059 - Support markdown to italicize text](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues/1059?ref=blog.appflowy.io).

The requirements were fairly simple: _Add a function to enable italics via use of single asterisks._

After going through the codebase, I knew it would just involve copying and editing a pre-existing function that did the same for underscores, so I decided to go ahead with it.

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-10.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="A view of the issue that I decided to take on" />

I started by asking one of the moderators if I could work on the issue. The core team got back to me on what I could work on, specifically with respect to the given issue. Once I got assigned the issue, I was ready to get started.

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-11.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="Always Ask Questions - Clarify your thoughts, as well as your plans for implementation with the Team" />

### How I Solved It

As mentioned before, it was a fairly straightforward issue, with code already present in the codebase that could be reused for the same.

However, I had a lot of trouble setting up my development environment. This is a common issue for first-timers, so don't worry if you have trouble setting up your environment as well.

I had issues with the unpacking of the cargo files for the Rust backend. This mostly came down to my antivirus flagging all the incoming files needed for development.

It took a while of troubleshooting, and asking for help from the community, but I was eventually able to figure it out and get the environment up and running.

Some things that I did to smoothen my onboarding experience included:

*   Reading up on AppFlowy's documentation and searching for cases where this bug has been encountered before, and how it was dealt with.
*   Searching on online platforms for cases where such an error was encountered before. This included combing through popular sites like Stack Overflow, other GitHub repositories, BitBucket, etc. for any instances where this issue had occurred before, and any potential fixes for the same.
*   Creating an issue in the Issues tab and highlighting the exact problem that I faced. I carefully detailed the exact issue that I was facing, including screenshots, error messages, and any other relevant information pertaining to the issue that I was facing. (You can have a look at Issue [#2045](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues/2045?ref=blog.appflowy.io). This is a fairly good example of how one can approach roadblocks on their development journey).

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-12.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="An example of an issue created to help gain feedback from the community on how to best tackle it" />

*   Asking on Discord - you may do so on the flutter-101 and rust-101 channels.

Following these steps helped me successfully fix the issue that I was facing.

Also, _always document_ everything that occurs during the lifecycle of an issue resolution within your Issue and PR. Doing so will help future contributors who might encounter the same issue down the road.

With the environment up and running, it was time to make the changes needed to fulfill the task at hand.

I added the function required, tested it manually in my local environment, and pushed the ensuing commit into my forked repository's branch. I then created a pull request for the same and awaited my first code review.

### Clarifying Doubts With Maintainers

As always, feel free to ask questions when you have doubts and seek suggestions from the maintainers and the core team. You can ask questions related to any feature you'd like to implement, any bug that you've encountered, and so on.

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-13.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="An example of a community member helping me resolve an issue" />

### How I Handled Code Reviews With the Team

As a first-time contributor to a repository, you will be asked to sign the CLA, i.e., the [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement?ref=blog.appflowy.io).

Once that's done, your Pull Request will be assigned one or more reviewers. They are generally members of the core AppFlowy team or senior contributors. They know the codebase in and out, so feel free to ask for suggestions on how to tackle any developmental issue that you may face.

My reviewers left some suggested changes for the Pull Request, including changing keyboard conventions and other small changes.
<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-14.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="An example of a suggested review left by reviewers during a code review of a pull request" />


Another requirement that was put forward by the team was to make unit tests for the new feature.

Unit testing is important as it makes sure that indvidual changes made to a codebase function as intended. I had a horrid time writing these unit tests, as I was still very new to Flutter. But as always, feel free to ask for help.

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-15.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="Asking for help - just do it!" />

Always make sure you conform to the conventions put in place by the team such as:

*   Pull Request naming conventions
*   Following commit message guidelines
*   Eliminating warnings and TODOs

For more information on the naming conventions used in AppFlowy, check out our [code submission guidelines](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/software-contributions/submitting-code/code-submission-guidelines?ref=blog.appflowy.io)

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-16.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="Make sure you use the naming conventions specified by the AppFlowy documentation" />

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-17.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="Ended up having trouble with squashing some commits as well. This really was quite the journey 😅" />


Overall, I think I made quite a mess with my first Pull Request. From horrible coding practises to terrible naming conventions, I had it all!

But thanks to the community, I was able to navigate the entire process with relative ease. A big thank you to [Xazin](https://github.com/Xazin?ref=blog.appflowy.io) and [LucasXu](https://github.com/LucasXu0?ref=blog.appflowy.io) for all their help and support.

This really is what I admire the most at AppFlowy: the **Community**.

So stay hungry, always be open to suggestions, and you'll be surprised by just how much you can learn while working on a large-scale, open-source collaborative project like AppFlowy.

### The Final Merge Request

<Img src="/images/blog/how-to-contribute-to-appflowy/image-18.png" alt="AppFlowy Issue Page" caption="The first of many more Pull Requests!" />

### Things That I Learnt Through This Whole Experience

To summarize, here are my key takeaways from the entire experience:

*   Be open to suggestions and constructive criticism. We can't learn if we close our minds to change.
*   Learn the languages and frameworks of the codebase! I cannot stress this enough. Try to have a firm understanding of the basics of the frameworks and languages used, namely Flutter and Rust. Feel free to refer to the Section Resources for Getting Started With Technical Contributions below for the same.
*   Follow the conventions and standards put in place. Be it coding or naming conventions, make sure you follow the conventions put in place by the community.
*   Feel free to ask questions! But at the same time, make sure you've done your research. Whenever you encounter a roadblock, try Googling the issue first. Chances are, you'd be able to get an answer to your question without having to wait for a community member to respond. In case you're truly stuck, do not be afraid to reach out. The community is behind you every step of the way.
*   Document everything! Make sure to document any bugs and issues that you encounter. These can be useful to future contributors down the road, who may encounter the same.

## How to Best Engage With the Community


Here are some best practices to engage with the community here at AppFlowy:

*   Use welcoming and inclusive language
