*A look at the most powerful AI note-taking apps beyond OneNote that give users control, better organization, and smarter features - without sacrificing privacy.*

Remember when note-taking was just about jotting down quick thoughts in a physical notebook? Note-taking apps have come a long way since then, helping us capture ideas and connect our digital dots across work and personal life.

But now, AI has come along and enhanced how we use and interact with our notetaking apps. Digital notebooks are now intelligent assistants that can summarize your meetings, connect related concepts, and build content based on your notes. 

Microsoft OneNote has long been a reliable tool – especially for those who spend most of their days in Microsoft environments. But as privacy concerns about data use and LLM training increase, many are looking for the best OneNote alternatives that offer the same powerful AI feature without the bloat or privacy concerns.

As AI builders ourselves, we've compiled a guide to the best AI-powered OneNote alternatives available in 2025. And spoiler alert - the features that make the biggest difference aren't always the ones you see in splashy marketing campaigns.

## 1. [AppFlowy](https://appflowy.com/)

**Great for:** *Teams and individuals who value data ownership, privacy, and flexibility with the power of cloud and local AI integrations.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/Best-One-Note-Alternative-AppFlowy.png" alt="AppFlowy - Best OneNote Alternative" />

Full disclosure – we built AppFlowy, so we think it's the best AI alternative to OneNote on the market. 

But after watching countless users cycle through note-taking apps only to return to basic tools, we created something we truly believe solves the real problems.

AppFlowy offers a powerful note-taking experience with a modern interface, similar to Notion and you keep full control of your data. 

That means no more wondering if your notes are being used to train someone else's AI model or worrying about getting locked into Microsoft's 365 system with sudden price hikes restricting access to your own notes. We've built a self-hostable cloud based architecture that comes with offline support.

### Key Features

* **Self-hosting capability:** Run AppFlowy on your infrastructure (because your notes shouldn't live in someone else's house)  
* **Local AI through Ollama integration:** Get AI assistance without your musings being sent to the cloud  
* **Multiple database views:** Organize in grid, Kanban, and calendar layouts – because your brain doesn't think in just one format  
* **Cross-platform experience:** Available for desktop, mobile  and now as a web app  
* **Open-source transparency:** A strong, community-verified codebase with 64K+ GitHub stars – no hidden surprises in our code

We designed AppFlowy for people who are looking for a minimal yet powerful knowledge management system that lets you stay in full control of your data. Whether you're creating simple notes or building complex knowledge bases with AI assistance, you'll maintain complete control while still accessing powerful organizational tools – without needing a PhD to figure out how to use them.

## 2. [Notion](https://www.notion.com/)

**Great for:** *Teams and individuals looking for a flexible all-in-one workspace with cloud AI integration.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/notion-all-in-one.png" alt="Notion all-in-one workspace" />

Notion has changed from a simple note-taking app into a large, comprehensive workspace that combines all of your notes, documents, wikis, databases, and more into a single system. We like Notion's versatility. You can start with basic notes but gradually build complex systems as your needs grow. It's a bit more focused on databases than just note-taking, which might overwhelm some users – but those who know how to use it can quickly build a strong system.

The recent AI integration in Notion feels polished, but it lacks flexibility. You can't choose your own AI model or run anything locally. You're limited to whatever Notion provides. Still, it's woven throughout the platform to help you interact with your content and build new pages and databases with a click.

### Key Features

* **AI-driven workflows:** Transform existing content, summarize documents, and extract action items automatically  
* **Flexible database structures:** Create custom databases with multiple views (table, board, calendar, timeline)  
* **All-in-one platform:** Combine note‑taking, project management, email, and calendars into one system  
  Notion delivers on the promise of an all-in-one solution, but this comes with tradeoffs. While you get access to powerful features, performance can lag with larger workspaces, and the "build it yourself" approach means spending time on setup that could be spent on actual work. Plus, your data lives in their cloud - not yours.

## 3. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)

**Great for:** *Note collectors who prioritize multimedia capture and organization across devices.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/evernote-note-taking-tool.png" alt="Evernote note-taking tool" />

Evernote is the granddaddy of digital note-taking apps. It was initially one of the leading notetaking apps on the market, but changes and updates (as well as many new competitors) have dropped Evernote's spot on the list.

That said, Evernote is still a powerful tool for capturing and organizing information. Its recent AI implementation helps with summarization and content transformation, though it's not as deeply integrated as newer competitors.

### Key Features

* **Rich multimedia support:** Handles text, images, PDFs, handwritten notes, and audio recordings  
* **Advanced search capabilities:** Finds text even within images and PDFs  
* **AI assistant:** Summarizes notes, changes tone, and helps with formatting  
* **Web clipper:** One of the best tools for saving online content in various formats

Evernote excels at capturing information – which has always been the leading reason why many use (and keep using) the tool. However, the pricing structure has become increasingly restrictive for many, with the free plan limiting you to just 50 notes and one device.

## 4. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

**Great for:** *Knowledge workers building personal knowledge bases with complete data control.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/obsidian-knowledge-graph.png" alt="Obsidian knowledge graph" />

Obsidian is *the* tool if you're interested in connecting ideas across multiple notes and want to visualize those connections. 

Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Obsidian focuses on helping you build a network of interconnected thoughts - creating a "personal knowledge graph". Obsidian stores everything as local Markdown files, giving you complete data ownership while offering powerful visualization tools to see how your ideas connect. 

However, it's still lacking a strong AI feature. Relying on community plugins introduces security concerns and often leads to a compromised integration experience.

### Key Features

* **Knowledge graph visualization:** See connections between your notes with an interactive graph view  
* **Local storage:** Your notes are stored as plain Markdown files on your device  
* **Plugin ecosystem:** Over 1,000 community plugins for customization  
* **Bidirectional linking:** Create connections between notes that work in both directions

Obsidian emphasizes local-first storage, but its reliability and privacy can be compromised when using community plugins, which pose security concerns. Without plugins, its core is still powerful for personal knowledge management, though limited collaboration features make it less suitable for teams.

## 5. [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)

**Great for:** *Privacy-focused users who want a free, open-source alternative with complete data ownership.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/joplin-open-source-note-taking.png" alt="Joplin open-source note-taking" />

At AppFlowy, we built our tool around the idea of full data ownership – and of the OneNote alternatives on our list, Joplin is another key option on the market. 

This open-source alternative gives you control over where your content lives, whether that's on your personal devices or synced through services like Dropbox or OneDrive. Rather than locking you into a specific ecosystem, Joplin stores everything as standard Markdown files, making it easy to export or migrate your notes. However, it lacks officially supported database-style features like Kanban boards or grid views, which are a major limitation compared to tools like AppFlowy. As of now, Joplin also doesn't offer built-in AI features.

### Key Features

* **Open-source architecture:** The entire codebase is community-verified with no hidden data collection  
* **Flexible sync options:** Choose where your data lives (Dropbox, OneDrive, NextCloud, or Joplin Cloud)  
* **End-to-end encryption:** Keep sensitive notes completely private  
* **Markdown support:** Format notes with the clean simplicity of Markdown

While Joplin's desktop app can feel a bit sluggish at times (it lacks some of the polish of other alternatives), the data ownership element does make it a compelling choice as an alternative to OneNote for AI notetaking.

## 6. [Bear](https://bear.app/)

**Great for:** *Apple ecosystem users seeking elegant Markdown notes with minimal distractions.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/bear-apple-app.png" alt="Bear Apple app" />

If you're a bit more artsy – and want a distraction-free writing experience – then you'll want to check out the Bear notetaking app. An Apple-centric notes app, Bear combines a focus on elegant typography with a powerful internal organization system to create an easy-to-use note-building experience. 

Unlike cluttered alternatives, Bear maintains a minimalist interface that keeps your focus on writing while cleverly hiding powerful features until you need them. However, it lacks real-time team collaboration and doesn't offer database functionality, which may limit its use for more complex workflows.

### Key Features

* **Beautiful typography and themes:** Write in a visually pleasing environment with customizable fonts and colors  
* **Flexible Markdown editing:** Format text naturally without breaking your writing flow  
* **Powerful tag organization:** Organize with a simple but effective hashtag system like nested tags  
* **Apple ecosystem integration:** Works seamlessly across Mac, iPhone, and iPad  
* **Export options:** Share notes in multiple formats, including PDF, HTML, and DOCX

Bear's tag-based organization system makes finding notes easy, while its focus on typography creates a genuinely enjoyable writing experience. The major downside? It's exclusively for Apple users and doesn't yet have a strong AI feature integrated to give you more control or access to features many expect.

## 7. [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)

**Great for:** *Quick capture of ideas and simple lists across all your devices – especially if you live and breath Google.*

<Img src="/images/blog/2025-07-31/google-keep.png" alt="Google Keep" />

Sometimes, the best note-taking app is the one that gets out of your way when inspiration strikes. Google Keep excels at quick capture for just about anything in life, working like digital Post-It notes to help you keep track of lists and ideas.

Unlike more complex alternatives, Keep focuses on simplicity and speed, making it perfect for those moments when you just need to get something down before you forget it. But you won't find many strong note-taking features here that you'll see elsewhere. It's a bare-bones quick-note tool. As of now, Google Keep doesn't offer built-in AI features.

### Key Features

* **Simple card-based interface:** Visual organization with color-coding for quick recognition  
* **Cross-platform availability:** Access your notes on any device through the web or mobile apps  
* **Image capture with OCR:** Extract text from photos and make it searchable  
* **Google ecosystem integration:** Works great with Google Drive and Docs

Google Keep isn't trying to be a comprehensive knowledge management system, which is actually one of its strengths. Just be aware that, like most Google products, your data lives in Google's cloud, which might be a privacy concern for some users.

## What to Look for in a OneNote Alternative

### AI Capabilities That Actually Help You Use Your Notes

The AI features in a note‑taking app should be more than just a chatbot or search bar. You'll want to find an AI note‑taking tool that integrates deeply into your existing writing flow and offers capabilities to help you write and organize better.

What doesn't matter? Flashy AI features that look impressive in demos but don't help you work or write better.

### Strong Data Control & Privacy Features

You've spent years building your digital brain - the last thing you want is to lose access to it because a company changes its terms of service or decides to shut down a service. 

Real data control means open source transparency, self-hosting options, and local-first architecture that keeps your information on your device first.

### Consistent Accessibility & Reliability

Remember that moment when inspiration struck during your flight, but your note-taking app needed the internet to function? 

In 2025, an AI note-taking app should have the ability to work across all platforms and offer genuine offline support (not just read-only mode).

The app should also maintain performance as your collection grows, staying fast and responsive whether you have 100 notes or 10,000.

### Intuitive User Experience & Productivity

While pretty interfaces are nice, a *quality* user experience is about how smoothly you can capture and organize thoughts without breaking your flow. 

The best note-taking apps offer natural Markdown support to keep your hands on the keyboard and customization that matches how your brain works – rather than forcing your thinking to match the app's structure.
