So, you’ve been told to create a one-pager. One page. That’s it. Just cram all the essentials about your project, product, or team into one neat little document. Easy, right? Until you start writing, and suddenly, “one page” feels more impossible than a 1,000-page novel. Can’t we just stick with the brochures we’ve got? You ask.

Stop panicking. This will all be worth it. One-pagers make everyone’s life easier. Concise versions of internal documents marketing collateral allows you to convey all the important information people need to know and remember without overwhelming them.

In this article, we’ll give you some of the best free one-pager templates and some useful one-pager examples for you to implement today.

## What is a One-Pager?

A one-pager is exactly what it sounds like: a document condensed onto a single page. Unlike full-length presentations or reports, one-pagers focus only on the essentials. They don’t drown readers in details—instead, they’re straight to the point. A one-pager captures key information in a visually engaging format, making it easy for the reader to understand the core message without extra pages or slides.

## What Should a One-Pager Include?

Because space is limited, you have to be thoughtful with design and content. What you include in your one-pager will depend on its purpose, but there are a few non-negotiables that form part of any one-pager design..

**Key Messages**: Start with the main points or benefits that set your product, service, or idea apart. Use clear, straightforward language—no one needs jargon on a one-pager.

**Visuals**: Add icons, infographics, or simple charts that help illustrate your message without creating clutter. Visuals are easier to digest than words. Especially if you’re using data.

**Call to Action (CTA):** Guide readers to their next step with a clear, attention-grabbing CTA. Whether you want them to call, email, or visit a link, a bold button or highlighted box around your CTA can make it easy to spot.

**Be Concise:** Use short sentences or bullet points to keep information digestible. Every section should answer a question the reader might have, such as “What’s in it for me?” or “Why is this valuable?”

**Relevant Data:** Include statistics or facts that back up your message, like “20% boost in efficiency” or “Trusted by 500 companies.” Quick, impactful data points can add credibility without overloading the page.

**Visual Flow and Branding:** Arrange content to guide the reader’s eye naturally from top to bottom. With consistent brand colors, fonts, and logos, your one-pager will look professional while keeping focus on the message.
