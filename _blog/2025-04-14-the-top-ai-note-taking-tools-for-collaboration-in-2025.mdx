## A Closer Look at the Best AI-Note-Taking Software

### AppFlowy

If you're looking for simplicity and effectiveness from an [AI note-taking app](https://appflowy.com/blog/smart-note-taking-with-appflowy-ai), AppFlowy could be an ideal choice. Its clean and intuitive interface lets you jump straight into collaborative tasks without unnecessary distractions. Your team can work together in real-time, editing documents simultaneously with seamless responsiveness.

Where AppFlowy stands out is in how it handles AI. It offers free, local AI integration, which means everything runs on your machine or server‚Äînot someone else‚Äôs. That makes it both faster and more secure. It's also open-source and can be self-hosted, so you're not locked into anyone‚Äôs pricing model or platform. If data control and customisation matter to you, this ticks a lot of boxes.

**Pros of AppFlowy**

* Free, local AI integration
* Open source and can be self-hosted  
* Easy-to-use interface and smooth real-time collaboration  
* Simple web publishing for sharing content

**Cons of AppFlowy**

* Less ideal for very large teams requiring complex permissions

### Notion

[Notion](https://www.capterra.com/p/186596/Notion/) could be your best bet if you value versatility and a rich feature set. It offers a flexible workspace for everything from note-taking and wikis to databases, calendars, and the recently added email feature. Real-time collaboration works well, and once you're set up, it can be a solid all-in-one hub for your team‚Äôs work.

But all that flexibility comes with a cost. The sheer number of features can be overwhelming at first, especially if you're just trying to take notes and move on with your day. And because Notion is a closed-source, SaaS-based platform, you're trading control for convenience‚Äîmeaning you don‚Äôt own your data, and moving away later isn‚Äôt exactly a walk in the park.

**Pros of Notion**

* Highly versatile and customizable  
* Strong real-time [collaboration tools](https://appflowy.com/blog/7-Key-Features-in-Collaboration-Software-for-Team-Success)
* Can be adapted for a wide range of workflows

**Cons of Notion**

* Feature bloat can overwhelm new users  
* Closed-source and SaaS-based, so you give up control of your data and risk vendor lock-in

### Evernote

[Evernote](https://www.capterra.com/p/154969/Evernote-Business/) is ideal if you primarily manage extensive documentation or detailed notes, either individually or within small teams. Recent improvements have enhanced real-time collaboration, making simultaneous editing more effective and smooth.

Evernote‚Äôs AI capabilities, such as intelligent searches and automatic content summarization, are robust but are exclusively available on premium plans. Its restrictive free tier‚Äîlimited notes and synchronization‚Äîmight pose challenges if your team needs extensive use without additional costs.

**Pros of Evernote**

* Excellent individual note organization  
* Powerful AI tools in premium tier  
* Improved real-time collaboration

**Cons of Evernote**

* Restrictive free plan limits usage  
* AI tools only available in premium subscriptions

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://www.capterra.com/p/220063/Obsidian/) is a powerful choice if you prioritize privacy, data ownership, and structured personal knowledge management. It stores your notes locally, ensuring high security and full control over your data. Obsidian excels at visually linking notes, allowing you to clearly structure and explore your ideas through interconnected notes and visual representations.

However, Obsidian does not offer built-in real-time collaboration and requires third-party plugins for AI features, which can be technically demanding. If your team needs seamless collaboration or easy-to-use AI, Obsidian may not be the right fit.

**Pros of Obsidian**

* Exceptional data privacy and control  
* Strong visual knowledge management  
* Completely free for core features

**Cons of Obsidian**

* Limited collaborative capabilities  
* AI integration only through complex plugins
* Publish to Web is not free

### OneNote

If your team already uses Microsoft 365 extensively, [OneNote](https://www.capterra.com/p/227211/Microsoft-OneNote/) could seamlessly fit your existing workflow. It features an intuitive notebook interface that integrates effortlessly with other Microsoft apps. Real-time collaboration is reliable, letting your team coordinate effectively across documents.

OneNote‚Äôs AI features, powered by Microsoft's Copilot, significantly simplify note-taking tasks by creating automated summaries and content generation. However, to access these advanced features, you'll need a paid Microsoft 365 subscription, making it less attractive if your team isn't already within the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Pros of OneNote**

* Deep integration with Microsoft 365  
* Easy to use, familiar interface  
* Reliable real-time collaboration

**Cons of OneNote**

* Premium subscription required for advanced AI tools  
* Less beneficial outside Microsoft‚Äôs ecosystem

### Anytype

[Anytype](https://www.capterra.com/p/10010852/anytype/) is tailored for users who place a premium on security and privacy. Its local-first approach and encryption provide exceptional data protection. While Anytype is secured, it is not open source in the OSI-approved sense‚Äîmeaning users don‚Äôt get the full transparency, community governance, or forkability that come with truly open source software. Additionally, its decentralized model limits real-time collaboration, with synchronization occurring periodically rather than continuously.

Anytype allows extensive customization, letting you personalize your workspace significantly. Still, the absence of native AI tools and its steep learning curve mean it might best suit technically proficient users who prioritize data security and personalization over ease of use, open-source flexibility, and extensive collaborative functionality.

**Pros of Anytype**

- Excellent security and data privacy
- High level of customization
- Robust offline capabilities

**Cons of Anytype**

- Not open source
- Limited real-time collaborative options
- No built-in AI integration
- Complex learning curve for new users
